Our product, the Fundamint Platform, is managed software and infrastructure we created for brokers
and funding organizations facilitating capitalization. As a foundation of security, reliability,
and scalability our customers can adapt and grow without having to expand out of their core
competencies. Every broker has their own portal operated independently, or as part of a network
of brokers. This offers a unique environment where deals can be privately listed on their portal,
or published across all portals. A brokerâ€™s investor base gains access to more deals, their
companies can reach more investors, and still maintain their relationship with their customers.
