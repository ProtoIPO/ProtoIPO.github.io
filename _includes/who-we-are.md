ProtoIPO, Inc. was formed in early 2012 with the mission of reducing friction in capital markets.
We are a team that combines our strong technical base and financial industry experience to provide
products, services, and infrastructure towards that mission. We are built upon both existing deal
structures, and changes made in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.
